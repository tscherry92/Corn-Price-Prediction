# Corn Price Prediction
This project aims to develop a model that predicts the price range of corn for the upcoming month, as well as 6 and 12 months into the future.

## Overview
The project is divided into two stages:

### Stage One:
Utilizes historical data of corn prices, oil prices, and weather conditions from key American growing regions to make initial predictions.

### Stage Two:
Incorporates additional variables to enhance the modelâ€™s accuracy.

## Key Variables for Stage One
* Historic Corn Prices: Current corn prices influence future prices based on farmers' planting decisions for the current or next season.
* Oil Prices: Corn's use in ethanol production links its price to oil prices.
* Weather Conditions: Temperature, precipitation, and overall growing conditions in regions like Iowa, USA, and Pampas, Argentina.

## Additional Variables for Stage Two
* Soybean Prices: Interrelated production decisions between corn and soybeans.
* Livestock Prices: Corn's role in animal feed.
* Government Policies: Impact of agricultural policies, subsidies, and trade agreements.
* Currency Fluctuations: Influence of global trade and currency exchange rates.
* Fertilizer Prices: Cost implications for corn production.
* Insecticide and Fungicide Prices: Impact of pest and disease control on crop yield.
* Global Supply and Demand: International trade dynamics.
* Competition with Other Grains: Influence of wheat, rice, and soybean prices.
* Macro-Economic Conditions: Effects of inflation and economic health on commodity prices.

### Data Collection
The project involves collecting historical data on the aforementioned variables to train and refine the predictive model.
